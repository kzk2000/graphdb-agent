**Question:**<br>
Excellent. is it generally best to just add all kinds of user query variations to the sample questions of a particular table or are their other ways I should consider?

**Answer:**<br>
That's a very insightful question, and it touches on a key trade-off in building these systems: **quality vs. quantity**.

The short answer is: **No, it is not best to just add all kinds of user query variations.** While adding a few high-quality, diverse sample questions is one of the most effective strategies, overdoing it can lead to diminishing returns and even harm your system's performance.

You should consider a more balanced, multi-faceted approach to enriching your metadata. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the strategies and their pros and cons.

### Strategy 1: Adding Sample Questions (The "High-Impact" Tool)

This is your primary tool for capturing the *intent* and *phrasing* associated with a table.

*   **Pros:**
    *   **Excellent for Intent:** Directly teaches the embedding model what kinds of questions a table can answer. A query like "who are our newest users?" is a powerful signal for the `customers` table.
    *   **Captures Phrasing:** Helps the model understand different ways of asking the same thing (e.g., "how much did we sell?" vs. "what was our total revenue?").
    *   **Very Effective:** This is often the single most impactful change you can make to improve retrieval.

*   **Cons / Risks of Overuse:**
    *   **Topic Drift / Dilution:** If you add too many questions, especially ones that are only tangentially related, you can dilute the core meaning of the table's embedding. If you add 50 questions to the `orders` table, its vector might become a generic "business questions" vector instead of a sharp "transactions" vector.
    *   **Overfitting to Specific Phrasing:** The model might become too reliant on the exact phrasing of your sample questions and fail to generalize to truly novel queries.
    *   **Maintenance Nightmare:** A huge list of questions is hard to read, maintain, and reason about.

**Best Practice:**
*   Aim for **3 to 7 high-quality, diverse sample questions** per table.
*   Focus on questions that cover the **core purpose** and **most common use cases** of the table.
*   Ensure the questions use a variety of vocabulary (e.g., use "sell," "revenue," and "income" across different questions).

### Strategy 2: Enriching Descriptions (The "Foundation" Tool)

This is about creating a solid, descriptive foundation for the table and its columns.

*   **Pros:**
    *   **Defines Core Identity:** A well-written description is the most fundamental signal of a table's purpose. It's concise and directly impacts the embedding.
    *   **Highly Generalizable:** A good description helps with a wide range of queries, not just specific ones.
    *   **Easy to Maintain:** A single, clear paragraph is easier to manage than a long list of questions.

*   **Cons:**
    *   **Less Phrasing-Aware:** A description might not capture all the different ways a user might ask a question. It describes *what* the table is, not *how* it's queried.

**Best Practice:**
*   Write the `table_description` from the perspective of a business analyst, not a database administrator. Instead of "Stores order records," use "Tracks all customer sales transactions, including financial totals and dates, to analyze revenue and performance."
*   Do the same for `column_description`.

### Strategy 3: Adding Synonyms (The "Precision" Tool)

This is a surgical tool for fixing specific keyword mismatches.

*   **Pros:**
    *   **Directly Solves Keyword Gaps:** The most efficient way to teach the system that "partner" means `supplier` or "income" means `total_amount`.
    *   **Very Low Noise:** Adding a synonym is a very targeted change that doesn't dilute the overall embedding as much as adding a long, complex question.
    *   **Improves Both Retrieval and Generation:** Helps the vector search find the right column and helps the LLM use the right column.

*   **Cons:**
    *   **Doesn't Capture Intent:** Only solves for single words or short phrases, not the overall goal of a query.

**Best Practice:**
*   Use the "Keyword Gap Analysis" from our previous discussion to identify missing synonyms.
*   Focus on business terms, not just technical ones.

### The Recommended "Metadata Portfolio" Approach

Think of these three strategies as a balanced investment portfolio for your metadata. You shouldn't put all your effort into just one.

Here is the recommended hierarchy for an expert to follow when improving a table's metadata:

1.  **Start with the Foundation (Descriptions):**
    *   "Is the `table_description` clear and business-focused? Does it accurately reflect what this table is used for?"
    *   "Are the `column_description`s clear? Do they explain the purpose of the data?"

2.  **Use the Precision Tool (Synonyms):**
    *   "Did the user's query use a specific word (like 'partner' or 'income') that is missing as a synonym for a relevant table or column?"
    *   Add these directly to the `synonyms` list.
    
3.  **Use the High-Impact Tool (Sample Questions) Sparingly:**
    *   "Does the user's query represent a common *type* of question that is not captured in our existing samples?"
    *   If yes, add **one** new, well-phrased sample question that captures this intent. Avoid adding a dozen slight variations of the same question.

**Example of a Balanced `suppliers.yaml`:**

```yaml
table_name: suppliers
# 1. A strong, business-focused description
table_description: "A catalog of all business partners, vendors, and companies that supply products to us. Used to track sourcing and purchase value."

# 3. A few diverse, high-quality sample questions
sample_questions:
  - "Which suppliers provide our electronics?"
  - "List all partners located in Germany."
  - "What is the total purchase value from our top vendors?"

columns:
  - name: id
    type: integer
    description: "Unique identifier for a supplier, primary key."
  - name: company_name
    type: varchar
    # 1. A clear column description
    description: "The legal name of the supplier company."
    # 2. A targeted list of synonyms
    synonyms: ["supplier_name", "partner_name", "vendor"]
  # ...
```

This balanced approach ensures your embeddings are both **semantically rich** (from descriptions and questions) and **lexically precise** (from synonyms), making your retrieval system robust, accurate, and maintainable.
