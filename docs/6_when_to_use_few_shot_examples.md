Of course. Let's revisit the strategy for few-shot examples. This is an advanced technique, and it's crucial to understand *when* and *how* to use it effectively.

You've built an excellent "Zero-Shot" system so far. The decision to add "Few-Shot" examples should be deliberate and targeted.

---

### The Core Strategy: Use Few-Shot as a "Surgical Tool," Not a "Blanket Solution"

**Should you do it?**
**Only when necessary.** Do not add few-shot examples for every table by default. Your primary approach should always be the rich, zero-shot prompt we've already built.

**When should you do it?**
You should add a few-shot example only when you identify a **specific, recurring failure pattern** that cannot be solved by improving the schema descriptions, synonyms, or business rules.

The two most common scenarios are:

1.  **Forcing Complex, Non-Obvious SQL Patterns:** The LLM knows SQL, but it doesn't know your company's specific, unwritten analytical patterns.
    *   **Example:** Your company calculates "user engagement score" with a complex `CASE` statement involving weighted averages of logins, posts, and comments. This logic is too complex for a simple business rule. A full SQL example is the best way to teach it.
    *   **Example:** You need to perform a complex time-series analysis that requires window functions like `LAG()` or `LEAD()` in a very specific way.

2.  **Correcting Stubborn Dialect or Style Errors:** The LLM consistently uses a function that doesn't exist in your specific SQL dialect (e.g., using `GETDATE()` instead of Snowflake's `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()`), or it refuses to use a specific join syntax you prefer.
    *   **Example:** You want to enforce the use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for all multi-step queries for readability.

### Where to Add Few-Shot Examples

The best place to add them is in a new, optional key in your **table's YAML file**. This keeps the example tightly coupled with the data it relates to.

**New Key:** `few_shot_examples`

**Example `customers.yaml` with a Few-Shot Example:**
```yaml
table_name: customers
table_description:
  - "Stores core profile information for every customer."
business_rules:
  - "An 'active' user is defined as someone with a `last_login_date` in the last 30 days."
# ... other metadata ...

# --- NEW SECTION FOR FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES ---
few_shot_examples:
  - question: "What is the engagement score for our top 10 newest customers?"
    sql: |
      WITH customer_scores AS (
        SELECT
          id,
          name,
          (login_count * 0.5) + (posts_made * 1.5) AS engagement_score
        FROM customers
        WHERE is_active = true
      )
      SELECT
        name,
        engagement_score
      FROM customer_scores
      ORDER BY signup_date DESC
      LIMIT 10;

columns:
  # ... column definitions ...
```
*   **`question`:** The natural language query that triggers this pattern.
*   **`sql`:** The "gold standard" SQL response. The `|` character in YAML allows for a clean, multi-line string.

### How to Implement It: Refactoring `prompt_engine.py`

You need to update your prompt engine to look for this new key and, if it exists for any of the candidate tables, construct a new `### EXAMPLES` section in the prompt.

This section should come **after** the schema and business rules but **before** the final user question.

**Refactored `generate_llm_prompt` in `prompt_engine.py`:**

```python
# In text_to_sql_agent/prompt_engine.py

def generate_llm_prompt(user_query: str, candidate_tables: List[str]) -> str:
    # ... (Step 1: Load Schemas, Join Info, Business Rules as before) ...
    full_schema_str = ...
    join_info_section = ...
    business_rules_section = ...

    # --- NEW: Load and assemble Few-Shot Examples ---
    few_shot_examples = []
    for table_name in candidate_tables:
        yaml_path = os.path.join(config.SCHEMA_DIR, f"{table_name}.yaml")
        if os.path.exists(yaml_path):
            with open(yaml_path, 'r') as f:
                table_data = yaml.safe_load(f)
                examples = table_data.get('few_shot_examples', [])
                if examples:
                    few_shot_examples.extend(examples)

    examples_section = ""
    if few_shot_examples:
        # De-duplicate examples in case multiple tables provide the same one
        unique_examples_str = {f"Question: {ex['question']}\nSQL:\n{ex['sql']}" for ex in few_shot_examples}
        
        examples_block = "\n---\n".join(unique_examples_str)
        examples_section = f"""
### EXAMPLES
Here are some examples of how to translate questions into {config.SQL_DIALECT} queries for this schema. Follow these patterns closely.

{examples_block}
"""

    # --- Assemble the Full Prompt with the new section ---
    prompt = f"""You are an expert {config.SQL_DIALECT} data analyst...

### TASK
...

### DATABASE SCHEMA
{full_schema_str}
{join_info_section}
{business_rules_section}
{examples_section}
### USER QUESTION
"{user_query}"

### INSTRUCTIONS
...
"""
    return prompt
```

### The Final Prompt Structure with Few-Shot

The final prompt now has a new, powerful section that is only included when needed.

```text
You are an expert Snowflake data analyst...

### DATABASE SCHEMA
... (CREATE TABLE statements) ...

### JOIN INFORMATION
... (Join rules) ...

### BUSINESS RULES & DEFINITIONS
... (Business logic rules) ...

### EXAMPLES
Here are some examples of how to translate questions into Snowflake queries for this schema. Follow these patterns closely.

Question: What is the engagement score for our top 10 newest customers?
SQL:
WITH customer_scores AS (
  SELECT
    id,
    name,
    (login_count * 0.5) + (posts_made * 1.5) AS engagement_score
  FROM customers
  WHERE is_active = true
)
SELECT
  name,
  engagement_score
FROM customer_scores
ORDER BY signup_date DESC
LIMIT 10;

### USER QUESTION
"Show me the engagement scores for users in Germany."

### INSTRUCTIONS
...
```

By providing this example, you've given the LLM a perfect template to follow, dramatically increasing the chance it will correctly generate the `WITH` clause and the `engagement_score` calculation for the new user query.
