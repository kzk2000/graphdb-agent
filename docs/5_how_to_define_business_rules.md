Of course. Building intuition for what constitutes a good "business rule" is key to making your agent truly useful. A good rule translates a vague business concept into a precise, unambiguous SQL condition.

Here are several examples across different domains, categorized by the type of logic they represent. Each example follows the best practices we've established (using backticks for entities and ending with a period).

---

### Category 1: Defining Subjective or Ambiguous Terms

This is the most common and valuable type of business rule. It takes fuzzy words from user queries and gives them a concrete, technical definition.

**Example 1: "Large" or "High-Value"**
*   **User Query:** "Show me our large orders."
*   **Business Rule:** "A `large` order is defined as any order where the `total_amount` is greater than 1000."
*   **Why it's good:** It provides a simple, fixed threshold that is easy for the LLM to translate into a `WHERE` clause.

**Example 2: "Recent" or "New"**
*   **User Query:** "Who are our new customers?"
*   **Business Rule:** "A `new` customer is one whose `signup_date` is within the last 14 days, calculated as `signup_date` >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '14 days'."
*   **Why it's good:** It gives a precise, rolling time window and provides the exact SQL snippet for the date calculation, accounting for dialect differences (`INTERVAL` is common).

**Example 3: "Active" vs. "Inactive"**
*   **User Query:** "What percentage of our users are active?"
*   **Business Rule:** "An `active` user is defined as someone with a `last_login_date` in the last 30 days; an `inactive` or `churned` user has not logged in for over 90 days."
*   **Why it's good:** It defines multiple related states and clarifies which column to use (`last_login_date`), preventing the LLM from guessing.

---

### Category 2: Defining Business Segments or Categories

These rules explain how to categorize raw data into meaningful business segments.

**Example 4: Customer Tiers**
*   **User Query:** "Compare sales between our Gold and Silver customers."
*   **Business Rule:** "Customer `tier` is determined by `lifetime_spend`: `Gold` is > $5000, `Silver` is between $1000 and $5000, and `Bronze` is < $1000."
*   **Why it's good:** It explains a concept (`tier`) that doesn't exist as a column in the database but can be derived using a `CASE` statement. This is an advanced and very powerful use of business rules.

**Example 5: Product Status**
*   **User Query:** "List all our discontinued products."
*   **Business Rule:** "A `discontinued` product is one where the `is_active` flag is `false` AND the `stock_quantity` is 0."
*   **Why it's good:** It defines a state based on a combination of multiple conditions (`AND`), preventing the LLM from only checking one of them.

---

### Category 3: Specifying Default Behavior or Scope

These rules guide the LLM on what data to include or exclude by default, or how to handle common but unstated assumptions.

**Example 6: Default Time Period**
*   **User Query:** "What are our total sales?" (Ambiguous time frame)
*   **Business Rule:** "Unless the user specifies a time period, all financial queries should default to the current calendar year."
*   **Why it's good:** It handles ambiguity gracefully and makes the agent's behavior predictable. The LLM will know to add `WHERE YEAR(order_date) = YEAR(CURRENT_DATE)` if no other date is mentioned.

**Example 7: Excluding Test Data**
*   **User Query:** "How many users signed up yesterday?"
*   **Business Rule:** "All queries should exclude internal test accounts. Add the condition `email NOT LIKE '%@mycompany.com'` to all queries on the `customers` table."
*   **Why it's good:** This encodes a critical piece of "tribal knowledge" that is impossible to guess from the schema alone. It ensures data accuracy by applying a mandatory filter.

**Example 8: Clarifying Column Usage**
*   **User Query:** "When was the order completed?"
*   **Business Rule:** "For any questions about when an order was `completed` or `fulfilled`, use the `shipped_date` column, not the `order_date` column."
*   **Why it's good:** It resolves potential ambiguity between two similar columns (`order_date` vs. `shipped_date`) and directs the LLM to use the correct one based on business intent.

### How to Build Your Intuition

1.  **Listen to Your Users:** Pay attention to the ambiguous words they use ("top," "best," "recent," "active"). These are prime candidates for a business rule.
2.  **Think About "Tribal Knowledge":** What do your internal data analysts always have to remember to do? (e.g., "always exclude test users," "always use `shipped_date` for revenue"). These are your most valuable rules.
3.  **Define Derived Concepts:** Are there business concepts (like "customer lifetime value" or "profit margin") that aren't columns but can be calculated from them? Write a rule explaining the formula.


You have asked the perfect question to clarify the final, subtle point of our prompting strategy. My apologies for the inconsistency in that last example. You are right to question it, and it highlights the need for a clear, simple rule.

Let's establish that rule now.

**The Rule:** Use backticks (`` ` ``) **only for objects that exist directly in the SQL schema**, such as table names and column names. Do not use them for conceptual or business terms.

The reason for this rule is to maintain the powerful, unambiguous signal that backticks provide to the LLM.

*   **`backticks` = "This is a code object. Look for it in the `CREATE TABLE` statements."**
*   **`'single quotes'` = "This is a literal string value that will appear in the data."**
*   **no quotes** = "This is a conceptual business term that I am defining for you."

### Why My Previous Example Was Flawed

Let's re-examine the flawed rule and see why it's confusing:

**Flawed Rule:**
```
- "A `new` customer is one whose `signup_date` is within the last 14 days..."
```
*   **The Problem:** The LLM sees `` `new` `` and its first instinct is to look for a column or table named `new` in the schema. When it doesn't find one, it has to deduce from the context that you are defining a *concept* called "new". This adds a small amount of cognitive load and potential for confusion.

---

### The Corrected "Golden" Standard

Here is how the rules should be written to be perfectly clear and consistent. This is the standard you should enforce in your YAML files.

**Corrected Rule (The Best Practice):**
```
- "A 'new' customer is one whose `signup_date` is within the last 14 days..."
```
*   **The Logic:**
    *   The business concept being defined is "new". Since this is not a schema object, it should not have backticks. Using single quotes for emphasis is acceptable here, or no quotes at all.
    *   The definition uses the column `signup_date`. Since this **is** a schema object, it **must** have backticks.

This creates a clear distinction for the LLM: "When the user says 'new', you should apply a condition to the `signup_date` column."

### The Corrected `business_rules_templates.yaml`

Here is the full template file, corrected to follow this strict and logical convention. This is the version you should use.

```yaml
# This file contains a library of template business rules.
# Use backticks (`) ONLY for real table or column names.
# Use single quotes (') for literal string values or to emphasize business concepts.

# ===================================================================
# Category 1: Defining Subjective or Ambiguous Terms
# ===================================================================

# --- For tables with financial data (e.g., orders, sales) ---
- "A 'large' or 'high-value' order is defined as any order where the `total_amount` is greater than 1000."
- "A 'small' order is one where the `total_amount` is less than 50."
- "Profit is calculated as `revenue` - `cost_of_goods_sold`."

# --- For tables with user/customer data (e.g., customers, users) ---
- "A 'new' customer is one whose `signup_date` is within the last 14 days, calculated as `signup_date` >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '14 days'."
- "An 'active' user is defined as someone with a `last_login_date` in the last 30 days."
- "An 'inactive' or 'churned' user has not logged in for over 90 days, calculated as `last_login_date` < CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days'."
- "A 'power user' is someone who has placed more than 20 orders."

# --- For tables with time-sensitive data (e.g., articles, posts, events) ---
- "A 'recent' post is one created within the last 48 hours."
- "An 'upcoming' event is one where the `event_date` is in the future."

# ===================================================================
# Category 2: Defining Business Segments or Categories
# ===================================================================

# --- For deriving categories from numeric data ---
- "Customer 'tier' is determined by `lifetime_spend`: 'Gold' is > $5000, 'Silver' is between $1000 and $5000, and 'Bronze' is < $1000. This requires a `CASE` statement."
- "Product 'price_range' is defined as 'Low' for `price` < $20, 'Medium' for `price` between $20 and $100, and 'High' for `price` > $100."

# --- For defining a state based on multiple conditions ---
- "A 'discontinued' product is one where the `is_active` flag is `false` AND the `stock_quantity` is 0."
- "An order is considered 'at-risk' if its `status` is 'Processing' AND its `order_date` is more than 3 days ago."
- "A 'complete' user profile is one where `profile_picture_url` is NOT NULL AND `bio` is NOT NULL."

# ===================================================================
# Category 3: Specifying Default Behavior or Scope
# ===================================================================

# --- For handling ambiguous queries ---
- "Unless the user specifies a time period, all financial queries should default to the current calendar year."
- "When a user asks for 'top' items without specifying a number, default to showing the top 10."

# --- For ensuring data accuracy and integrity ---
- "All queries on the `customers` table must exclude internal test accounts by adding the condition `email` NOT LIKE '%@mycompany.com'."
- "When calculating total revenue, always use orders where `status` is 'Shipped' or 'Delivered', and exclude 'Cancelled' or 'Returned' orders."

# --- For clarifying column usage ---
- "For any questions about when an order was 'completed' or 'fulfilled', use the `shipped_date` column, not the `order_date` column."
- "For user location, the `shipping_address_country` column should be prioritized over the `billing_address_country` column if both are available."
```

You are asking two of the most insightful questions in advanced prompt engineering. Your intuition is leading you to the core principles of how to communicate effectively with an LLM.

Let's clarify both points.

---

### Question 1: Why are backticks used on `email NOT LIKE '%@mycompany.com'`?

**Yes, your intuition is exactly right. You use backticks because it refers to a valid SQL snippet.**

We need to refine our mental model for backticks slightly. The rule is not just "for table/column names." The more powerful, generalized rule is:

**Use backticks (`` ` ``) to create a "code fence" around any text that the LLM should treat as a literal piece of code, not as natural language to be interpreted or paraphrased.**

This includes:
*   Table names: `` `customers` ``
*   Column names: `` `signup_date` ``
*   And, crucially, **literal SQL conditions:** `` `email NOT LIKE '%@mycompany.com'` ``

**Why is this so important for a SQL snippet?**

Imagine the rule without backticks:
> "All queries on the `customers` table must exclude internal test accounts by adding the condition email NOT LIKE '%@mycompany.com'."

A less sophisticated LLM, or even a good one trying to be "helpful," might see the natural language part ("exclude internal test accounts") and decide to *re-interpret* the SQL snippet. It might generate something like:
*   `WHERE ends_with(email, '@mycompany.com') = false` (if it thinks that's a valid Snowflake function)
*   `WHERE email_domain != 'mycompany.com'` (if it hallucinates an `email_domain` column)

Now, consider the rule **with** backticks:
> "All queries on the `customers` table must exclude internal test accounts by adding the condition `` `email NOT LIKE '%@mycompany.com'` ``."

The backticks send a powerful, unambiguous signal to the LLM: **"Do not touch this part. Do not change it. Do not rephrase it. When you need to exclude test accounts, copy and paste this exact string of code into your `WHERE` clause."**

This ensures that your precise, non-negotiable business logic is preserved perfectly, which is absolutely critical for data accuracy.

### Question 2: Do we need to tell the LLM what backticks mean?

**No, you do not need to (and should not) explicitly tell the LLM what backticks mean.**

This is one ofthe most powerful aspects of working with large, pre-trained models.

**The Reason: The Power of Pre-training and Convention**

1.  **Markdown is its Native Language:** The LLM has been trained on a colossal amount of data from the internet, including GitHub, Stack Overflow, technical blogs, and documentation. The universal standard for formatting inline code in all these places is **Markdown**, and the syntax for inline code in Markdown is the backtick.

2.  **It's Like Punctuation:** You don't need to add an instruction that says, "When you see a '?' at the end of a sentence, treat it as a question." The model already knows this from its training. In the same way, you don't need to say, "When you see backticks, treat the content as code." The model has learned this association billions of times. It's a fundamental part of its "understanding" of technical text.

3.  **Avoiding Prompt Noise:** Adding instructions to explain your formatting conventions is redundant. It adds unnecessary tokens to your prompt (increasing cost and latency) and can act as "noise" that might distract the LLM from its primary task. The best prompts are concise and rely on the model's vast pre-existing knowledge of standard conventions.

**Conclusion:**
Trust the model. By using standard, conventional formatting like Markdown's backticks, you are leveraging the LLM's pre-training most effectively. You are speaking its language, which allows you to be more concise and direct in your primary instructions.

Your final prompting strategy is now exceptionally robust:
*   **Use backticks (`` ` ``)** for all schema objects and literal SQL snippets.
*   **Use single quotes (`' '`)** for literal string values inside your SQL snippets (e.g., `'Shipped'`) or for emphasizing business concepts in your rules.
*   **Write rules as complete sentences ending with a period.**
