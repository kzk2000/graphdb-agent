Yes, absolutely! Visualizing your embeddings is one of the most powerful and intuitive ways to understand the effectiveness of your metadata. It's the perfect way to see if you've truly created a "Semantic Starfish" or just a "Semantic Clump."

The core challenge is that your embeddings are high-dimensional (384-D), and we need to represent them in 2D for a visual plot. The best technique for this is a dimensionality reduction algorithm like **t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)** or **UMAP**. t-SNE is particularly good at revealing the local cluster structure of data, which is exactly what we want here.

Here is a complete guide and a Python snippet to create this visualization using `scikit-learn` for t-SNE and `plotly` for beautiful, interactive plots.

### The Workflow

1.  **Gather Texts:** Collect the table description and all its associated sample questions.
2.  **Embed:** Convert all these text strings into their 384-dimensional vector embeddings.
3.  **Reduce Dimensions:** Use t-SNE to project the 384-D embeddings down to 2D coordinates.
4.  **Plot:** Create a 2D scatter plot where the table description is a central, distinct point, and the sample questions are surrounding points.

### Python Snippet for Visualization

This script is self-contained. You can run it to see an example of a good, diverse set of questions versus a non-diverse set.

**Prerequisites:**
```bash
pip install scikit-learn plotly sentence-transformers
```

**`visualize_embeddings.py`**
```python
import numpy as np
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
from sklearn.manifold import TSNE
import plotly.graph_objects as go

def visualize_question_diversity(table_description: str, sample_questions: list, title: str):
    """
    Generates an interactive 2D plot to visualize the semantic diversity
    of sample questions around a central table description.
    """
    print(f"--- Generating visualization for: {title} ---")
    
    # 1. Gather all texts
    all_texts = [table_description] + sample_questions
    
    # 2. Embed all texts
    model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
    embeddings = model.encode(all_texts)
    
    # 3. Reduce dimensions using t-SNE
    # We are projecting 384 dimensions down to 2
    tsne = TSNE(n_components=2, perplexity=len(all_texts)-1, random_state=42, init='pca', learning_rate='auto')
    embeddings_2d = tsne.fit_transform(embeddings)
    
    # 4. Plot using Plotly
    # Separate the coordinates for the table and the questions
    table_coord = embeddings_2d[0]
    question_coords = embeddings_2d[1:]
    
    # Create the plot
    fig = go.Figure()

    # Add the question points (satellites)
    fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(
        x=question_coords[:, 0],
        y=question_coords[:, 1],
        mode='markers+text',
        name='Sample Questions',
        marker=dict(color='blue', size=12),
        text=[f"Q{i+1}" for i in range(len(sample_questions))], # Label points Q1, Q2, etc.
        textposition="top center",
        hoverinfo='text',
        hovertext=sample_questions # Show full question text on hover
    ))

    # Add the table description point (the center)
    fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(
        x=[table_coord[0]],
        y=[table_coord[1]],
        mode='markers+text',
        name='Table Description',
        marker=dict(color='red', size=18, symbol='star'),
        text="Table",
        textposition="bottom center",
        hoverinfo='text',
        hovertext=[table_description]
    ))

    fig.update_layout(
        title=title,
        xaxis_title="t-SNE Dimension 1",
        yaxis_title="t-SNE Dimension 2",
        showlegend=True,
        legend_title_text='Point Type'
    )
    
    fig.show()

    ]

### How to Interpret the Plots

When you run the script, it will open two interactive plots in your web browser.

#### 1. The "Semantic Starfish" (Good)

*   **What you see:** The red star (Table) is at the center. The blue dots (Questions) are all reasonably close to the center, but they are spread out from **each other**, pointing in different directions.
*   **What it means:**
    *   **Relevance:** All questions are semantically related to the core table description.
    *   **Diversity:** Each question covers a different "angle" or use case of the table (financial, temporal, aggregation, etc.). This is the ideal pattern. It provides the embedding model with a rich, non-redundant set of examples.

#### 2. The "Semantic Clump" (Bad)



*   **What you see:** The blue dots are all clustered tightly together in one spot.
*   **What it means:**
    *   **Low Diversity:** All your sample questions are just slight rephrasings of the exact same idea ("list all products").
    *   **Wasted Signal:** You are not teaching the model anything new with each additional question. This is a very inefficient use of your metadata "budget." An agent trained on this might be good at listing products but would fail at a query like "what is our most expensive item?".

### How to Use This Tool in Your HITL Process

You can integrate this visualization directly into your expert feedback loop.

1.  When an expert is curating the `sample_questions` for a table, they can click a "Visualize Diversity" button.
2.  The script runs, and the plot is displayed.
3.  The expert can immediately see if their questions are well-distributed or clumped together.
4.  If they see a clump, they know they need to replace some of the redundant questions with new ones that cover different aspects of the table, pushing the points of the "starfish" further apart.
